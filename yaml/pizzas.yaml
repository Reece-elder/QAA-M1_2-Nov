# YAML is a configuration language used as InfraStructure as Code
# With YAML we write configurations and settings, that software can understand 

# YAML - Yet Another Markup Language 
# YAML - YAML Ain't Markup language

# YAML uses Key Value pairs
# My name is reece, my fav colour is purple and I live in Wales 
# my age is 27, my phone number is 07364
# I can swim, my fav word is false
# My fav foods are: yaki udon, peanut butter toast, mango
# My dog Boba is a corgi, who is fluffy, tri colour and bites me

# name is the key, Reece is the value

# When working with YAML the data types it takes in are: 
# Strings - text
# Numbers - 123
# Arrays - lists of data
# Boolean - true or false
# Objects

# Exercise Write a yaml file about yourself that includes atleast 5 key value pairs of different data types
# and also includes a nested object (pet, you could do fav book, fav recipe, family_member)
